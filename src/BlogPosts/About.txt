[Mathematics.ninja is a website]/[This website was]
 built, styled and deployed by me.
I built it with React.js; my knowledge of CSS, JS, and HTML; and nothing more.

The styling and design work was all me, as I do have an eye for style, though it is not my best feature I can still be proud of it.

I decided to do this simply as an exercise to learn React.js as I had never used it before. Then two weeks later I had a functioning website, which I will continue to add to.

I also intend to migrate a few of my more ambitious (often Python) endevours into a web-friendly format and add them onto here.

They are mostly mathematical visualisations and ways to be more interactive with the "Black-Box" many I have spoken to are mystified by.
Some are my attempts to answer a question that I had (number crunching probabilistic expectations for example).
And a few more are ways for me to use my skills with mathematics and programming to create tools for my hobbies.
